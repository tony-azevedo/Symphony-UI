%                Get frame vars command.  Returns an MxN array of doubles
%                which are the frame vars for the last plugin that ran
%                successfully.  Each row represents one frame (or 1 of 3
%                grayplanes in quad-frame mode).  The frame var columns of
%                the row can be identified by looking at the results
%                returns from the GetFrameVarNames.m method.  As of the
%                time of this writing, only two plugins support frame vars:
%                MovingObject and MovingGrating.
