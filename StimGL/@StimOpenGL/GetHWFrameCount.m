%    hwFrameCount = GetHWFrameCount(myobj)
%
%                Returns the number of frames that the video board has
%                drawn to the screen since some unspecified time in the
%                past.  The number returned is monotonically increasing and
%                does not require a currently running plugin.  It is
%                a count of the number of vblanks that the video board
%                has experienced since bootup.  However, on windows this
%                function is not supported natively and the obtained
%                framecount is unreliable at best.  Do not use on Windows.

%                DO NOT USE THIS FUNCTION FOR 'StimulateOpenGL II'
