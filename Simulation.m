    methods (Abstract)
        % This method should implement the simulation algorithm. When the SimulationDAQController "outputs" a portion of 
        % stimuli, this method will be called to request the simulated input to return. 
        %
        % The DAQController outputs stimuli in small time steps, meaning this method is likely called multiple times per
        % epoch. The duration of the current time step is available through timeStep.
        input = runner(obj, output, timeStep);
